## Introduction to Domain Analytics

- Data analytics is an evolution in a trend that has been continuing for hundreds of years: that of humans beings having ever greater access to information and data.
- The creation of human knowledge and data has been accelerating since the invention of the movable type printing press in the 15th century.
- These types of data analytics provide the inssight that businesses need to make effective and efficient decisions.
- Each type is used for specific purposes depending on the question a data analyst is to answer.
  * **Descriptive Analytics**
  * **Diagnostic Analytics**
  * **Predictive Analytics**
  * **Prescriptive Analytics**

## Introduction to Trade Analytics

- Trade analytics is a part of Big Data which generates good revenues for an organization and sets good examples of Big Data in sentiment analysis.
- The plan of Big Data is to collect and process the information related to specific markets and create a proper understanding of sentiments that drive customers facing various trading strategies and also to find the valuation of every single reliability.
- Trade analytics includes application in areas such as Pre-Trade Decision Making, Transaction Cost Analysis, High Frequency Trading(HFT), Sentiment Analysis.
- There is an increase in the demand for computerized algorithms because buy-side traders, Fund Managers and cost-driven Management are very keen to observe the cost involved in transactions.

## Application of Machine Learning

- Application of Analytics and natural language with unstructured data engineering across economic reportss benefiting the organizations by doing their manual work as automated knowledge based work provided with providing organizations with an automated quant capability.
- Analytical data also can identify client behavioral trends like their propensity to use a specific mode of communication (phone or email instead of post trade portals) and make last minute changes to account allocations, thereby, personalizing services and offering dynamic fee packages.
- Advance Analytics can also find the pattern and trends that inform the following best course of action.
  * **Supervised Learning** - The Models are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, KNN.
  * **Unsupervised Learning** - Unsupervised Learning Models are K-Means.

- Machine Learning techniques are more popular based on the below factors:
  * **Work Faster** : Models helps in making real-time decisions based on the activity of a customer and try to spot different pattern where there is irregularity.
  * **Scalability** : Models selects the similarities and dissimilarities in the behavior and quickly use the same to predict the future based on the time.
  * **Efficiency** : Models runs the given tasks repetitive, tedious, 24/7 and gives specific insight when needed by predicting.
  * **Accurate** : The models learn from regular behavior and got trained in such a way that it is very fast to adapt the changes when there is a difference in normal Transaction.

- The main AI techniques used for trade dectetion include:  Data Mining to classify, Cluster, and segment the data and automatically find associations and rules in the data that may signify interesting patterns, including those related to trade.
- Neural Networks works keeping human brain as reference. Neural Network contains different layers for computation.
- It uses cognitive computing that helps in building machines capable of using self-learning algorithms that involve the use of data mining, pattern recognition, and natural language processing. It is trained on a dataset passing it through diferent layers several times.
- It gives more accurate results than others models as it uses cognitive computing  and it learns from the patterns of authorized behavior.

##  Challenges of Trade Analysis

- Finally to conclude saying that revenue growth throgh greater telemetry Trading Analysis clearly has to focus on the trade itself. All the tick and  transaction data, however, should improve with all the contextual data that tells the whole story at the time of the trade.
- This includes items like routing data, external data, venue data, and a full lot more. Today, most analytical cycles occur once each day or overnight due to the challenges that institutions face in capturing massive volumes of traditional data.
- To stay ahead of the competition, Action helps companies mmove to intraday and near real-time data capture and collection frameworks, with near real-time analytics computation.
- Brokers can better serve trading customers and maximize their potential for brokerage revenues while buy-side firms gain greater visibility into the trade lifecycle so as to create better investment decisions and maximize portfolio returns.
